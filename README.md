# NHL-Fantasy-Hockey-Player-Database


### Mission Statement
- I am in a fantasy hockey league with a few friends and am not really familiar with the yahoo interface for pre-draft selection of players

### Objectives
- [ ] I want to create a set of two database tables with stats from the '23-'24 season which I can query against.
- [ ] I want to add a programmable interface where I can input the fantasy point parameters on a whim and figure out who the best players to pick at a given time may be.
- [ ] I want to make this future-compatible where stats from '24-'25 can be used instead of the previous season to make per-week adjustments depending on changes in production.


### Credits
- Data acquired from [Rotowire's NHL stats page](https://www.rotowire.com/hockey/stats.php) which is a full-file CSV dump of all stats for given years (currently back to 2010) for skaters and goalies.
